# Wes' Dot Files

My repo for configuration files, managed by [dot](https://github.com/ubnt-intrepid/dot).

## Installation

1. Install `dot`, either by building from source or downloading a binary.
2. Clone and install files: `dot init wezm`

## Notes

* You need to checkout submodules: `git submodule update --init`
* Run `base16_default-dark` once to set `~/.vimrc_background` to sync `vim` with the shell.
