# Normal keyboard orientation is when
# buttons are on the left side and knobs are on the right.
# However, you may want to use the keyboard in another orientation.
# To avoid remapping button positions in your head, just set it here.
# Possible values are:
#   (horizontal)
#   - 'normal': buttons on the left, knobs on the right
#   - 'upsidedown': buttons on the right, knobs on the left
#   (vertical)
#   - 'clockwise': buttons on the top, knobs on the bottom
#   - 'counterclockwise': buttons on the bottom, knobs on the top
orientation: normal

# Different keyboard models have different numbers of buttons and knobs.
# Set it here for proper handling.
# Count rows and columns with the keyboard in normal orientation (knobs on the right)
rows: 1
columns: 3
knobs: 1

# Layers are sets of alternative key mappings.
# The current layer is changed using a button on the side of the keyboard
# and displayed with LEDs on top (only for the moment of changing).
# All keyboards I saw had three layers, but I suppose other variants exist.
layers:
  - buttons:
      # Array of buttons.
      # In horizontal orientations it's `rows` rows `columns` buttons each.
      # In vertical: `columns` rows `rows` buttons each.
      # Each entry is either a sequence of 'chords' or a mouse event.
      # A chord is a combination of one key with optional modifiers,
      # like 'b', 'ctrl-alt-a' or 'win-rctrl-backspace'.
      # It can also be just modifiers without a key: 'ctrl-alt'.
      # You may combine up to 5 chords into a sequence using commas: 'ctrl-v,ctrl-c'.
      # Arbitrary scan codes (decimal) may be given like this: '<101>'.
      - ["ctrl-w", "cmd-1", "cmd-3"]
      # - ["e", "f", "g", "h"]
      # - ["<100>", "j", "k", "l"]
    knobs:
      # Knobs are listed from left to right if horizontal.
      # Knobs are listed from top to bottom if vertical.
      # Knobs can be rotated counter-clockwise (ccw) or clockwise (cw)
      # and pressed down.
      - ccw: "wheelup"
        cw: "wheeldown"
        press: "click"
      # - ccw: "shift-wheelup"
      #   press: "shift-click"
      #   cw: "shift-wheeldown"

  # - buttons:
  #     # Mouse events are clicks ('click/lclick', 'rclick', 'mclick') or
  #     # wheel events ('wheelup', 'wheeldown') with one optional modifier,
  #     # only 'ctrl', 'shift' and 'alt' are supported ('ctrl-wheeldown').
  #     # Clicks may combine several buttons, like this: 'click+rclick'.
  #     - ["click", "lclick", "rclick", "mclick"]
  #     - ["click+rclick", "wheeldown", "shift-wheelup", "ctrl-wheelup"]
  #     - ["alt-wheelup", "ctrl-click", "wheelup", "wheelup"]
  #   knobs:
  #     - ccw: "left"
  #       press: "enter"
  #       cw: "right"
  #     - ccw: "ctrl-left"
  #       press: "ctrl-enter"
  #       cw: "ctrl-right"

  # - buttons:
  #     # Multimedia commands are supported but
  #     # cannot be mixed with normal keys and modifiers.
  #     - ["play", "prev", "next", "mute"]
  #     - ["2", "3", "4", "5"]
  #     - ["6", "7", "8", "9"]
  #   knobs:
  #     - ccw: "volumedown"
  #       press: "mute"
  #       cw: "volumeup"
  #     - ccw: "d"
  #       press: "e"
  #       cw: "f"
